name: InsuranceStack Insurance Platform
summary: Full-stack insurance platform (web + 5 Go microservices in monorepo)
details: |
  InsuranceStack is a complete insurance management platform demo showcasing:
  - React web application with reactive feature management (SSE)
  - 5 Go microservices (policy, claims, pricing, customer, payments)
  - CloudBees CI/CD workflows with monorepo structure
  - Helm-based Kubernetes deployment
  - 7 feature flags with real-time updates
  - Subdomain-based routing with wildcard DNS

  This scenario automatically creates:
  - GitHub repository (forked from CB-InsuranceStack/InsuranceStack)
  - CloudBees component
  - CloudBees environment with FM_TOKEN variable
  - CloudBees application linking component and environment

  REQUIRED: KUBECONFIG secret must exist at organization level
  The scenario will prompt you to create it if missing.

  After setup completes, manually trigger the build-and-test workflow to deploy.
  The application will be available at:
  https://insurancestack-{project_name}-{project_name}-{environment}.demos.se-main-demo.sa-demo.beescloud.com

  Examples:
  - Project "acme", env "dev": https://insurancestack-acme-acme-dev.demos.se-main-demo.sa-demo.beescloud.com
  - Project "customer1", env "staging": https://insurancestack-customer1-customer1-staging.demos.se-main-demo.sa-demo.beescloud.com

  URL Pattern: {app_name}-{instance_id}-{environment_name}.{base_domain}
  - app_name: "insurancestack" (static in workflow)
  - instance_id: {project_name} (dynamic, from scenario parameter)
  - environment_name: "{project_name}-{environment}" (dynamic, from scenario parameters)
  - base_domain: "demos.se-main-demo.sa-demo.beescloud.com" (wildcard DNS)

  Note: Mimic performs file replacements to inject your project_name and environment
  into the workflow file before the first run.
